            <h1>Intorduction :</h1>
        Hershey's Kisses share a deep-rooted connection with the main Hershey's
        chocolate brand, serving as a beloved extension of its rich heritage and
        commitment to quality. While Hershey's Kisses boast their unique charm
        and iconic shape, they're crafted from the same premium milk chocolate
        that has made Hershey's synonymous with indulgence for generations. The
        success of Hershey's Kisses is a testament to the company's dedication
        to excellence and innovation, maintaining the same standards of taste
        and craftsmanship that define the broader Hershey's chocolate range.
        Whether enjoyed alone or alongside other Hershey's classics, Hershey's
        Kisses remain an integral part of the brand's legacy, embodying the joy
        and sweetness that Hershey's Chocolate has come to represent.
